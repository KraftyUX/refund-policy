# Refund Policy for Framer Components
## Author: [Krafty UX](https://framer.link/DEqY8D1)

---

## **1. No Refunds for Digital Products**
KR Testimonials is a **digital product** with a forking system. Each purchase grants **lifetime access** to the component and all future updates.

**Refunds are not offered after purchase** because:
- The component can be **instantly downloaded and forked**.
- Forking could enable abuse, such as redistribution or duplicate claims.

---

## **2. Pre-Purchase Support**
**Unsure if KR Testimonials fits your needs?** Contact us **before purchasing** at [kraftyux@gmail.com](mailto:kraftyux@gmail.com). We’re happy to:
- Share a **demo video** or **sandbox preview**.
- Answer **technical questions**.
- Clarify **use cases** or **licensing terms**.

---

## **3. Exceptions (Extremely Rare)**
Refunds **may** be considered **only** in the following cases:

### **Eligible Scenarios**
- **Duplicate Purchase:** If you accidentally purchased duplicates (e.g., due to a payment error). **Proof of duplicate charges is required.**
- **Verifiable Bug:** If the component **fails to work entirely** due to a verifiable bug (e.g., crashes in Framer). **Proof of attempts to resolve the issue with our support team is required.**

### **How to Request an Exception**
Email [kraftyux@gmail.com](mailto:kraftyux@gmail.com) **within 3 days of purchase** with:
- Your **order ID** (from Lemon Squeezy).
- A **detailed description** of the issue (e.g., screenshots, error logs).
- **Proof of prior support attempts** (if applicable).

### **Resolution Time**
- **3–5 business days** for review and response.

## **4. Anti-Abuse Measures**
To prevent abuse of the forking system:
- **One license per purchase.**
- **No refunds for misuse:** Refunds will **not** be granted if the component is used in violation of our licensing terms (e.g., redistribution).
