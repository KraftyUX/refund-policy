1. No Refunds for Digital Products

KR Testimonials is a digital product with a forking system, meaning each purchase grants lifetime access to the component and its updates.

Refunds are not offered after purchase, as the component can be instantly downloaded and forked (which could enable abuse, such as redistribution or duplicate claims).

2. Pre-Purchase Support

Unsure if this component fits your needs? Contact us before purchasing at kraftyux@gmail.com. We’re happy to:

3. Exceptions (Extremely Rare)

Refunds may be considered only if:

You accidentally purchased duplicates (e.g., due to a payment error). Proof of duplicate charges is required.

The component fails to work entirely due to a verifiable bug (e.g., crashes in Framer). Proof of attempts to resolve the issue with our support team is required.

Your order ID (from Lemon Squeezy).

Proof of prior support attempts (if applicable).

Resolution Time: 3–5 business days.

4. Anti-Abuse Measures

To prevent abuse of the forking system:

One license per purchase

No Refunds for Misuse: Refunds will not be granted if the component is used in violation of our licensing terms (e.g., redistribution).

5. Framer Marketplace Compliance
